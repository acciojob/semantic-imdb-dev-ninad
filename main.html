	<section id="actor">In April of 1945, the Allies make their final push into Nazi Germany, encountering fanatical resistance. Don "Wardaddy" Collier, a battle-hardened U.S. Army Staff Sergeant in the Second Armored Division, commands an M4 Sherman tank nicknamed Fury and its veteran crew: gunner Boyd "Bible" Swan, loader Grady "Coon-Ass" Travis, driver Trini "Gordo" Garcia, and assistant driverâ€“bow gunner "Red," all of whom have fought together since the North African campaign. Red is killed in a tank battle and replaced by Private First Class Norman Ellison, a young clerk from V Corps.</section>
